# Bank Application

Welcome to the **Bank Application** repository! This is a full-fledged backend banking application built using the **MERN stack** (MongoDB, Express.js, Node.js). Currently, the focus is on the backend, which handles user authentication, account management, and transaction services. The frontend will be created at a later stage.

## Project Overview

The **Bank Application** is designed to handle core banking functionalities such as user registration, login, account management, and fund transfers. The backend API has been built using Node.js, Express.js, and MongoDB, and is designed to be scalable and secure.

### Key Features (Backend Only):
- **User Registration & Authentication**: Users can register, log in, and manage their accounts using JWT for secure authentication.
- **Account Management**: Users can create, view, and delete bank accounts.
- **Transaction Management**: Users can view their transaction history and make fund transfers.
- **Admin Panel**: Admins can view, manage user accounts, and oversee transactions.

### Frontend (To Be Created)
The frontend will be developed later to interact with the backend APIs. It will handle user interface and client-side logic, allowing users to interact with the banking application in a user-friendly way.

## Features

- **Secure Authentication**: JWT tokens are used for secure user authentication.
- **Account Creation**: Users can create new bank accounts.
- **Transaction History**: Users can view the history of transactions associated with their accounts.
- **Fund Transfers**: Users can transfer funds between their accounts.
- **Admin Management**: Admins have the ability to manage users and view transaction records.

## Technologies Used

The backend of the application is built using the following technologies:

### Backend:
- **Node.js**: JavaScript runtime for building scalable server-side applications.
- **Express.js**: Web application framework for Node.js, simplifying API development.
- **MongoDB**: NoSQL database for storing user and transaction data.
- **Mongoose**: ODM (Object Data Modeling) library for MongoDB and Node.js.
- **JWT (JSON Web Tokens)**: Secure token-based authentication system.
- **bcryptjs**: Password hashing library to ensure secure password storage.
- **dotenv**: To manage environment variables for sensitive information.
- **Cors**: Middleware for enabling cross-origin requests between the client and server.
- **cloudinary**: For managing and storing images, if applicable.
- **connect-mongo**: For session storage using MongoDB.
- **cookie-parser**: To parse cookies for session management.
- **express-session**: For handling user sessions.
- **multer**: Middleware for handling file uploads, if needed.
- **nodemailer**: For sending email notifications (e.g., for account registration or transactions).

### Development:
- **nodemon**: For auto-reloading the server during development.

## Installation Instructions

To get the backend of the application up and running locally, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository:**

   Open your terminal and clone the repository to your local machine:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Alphasf9/BANK.git


### Install Backend Dependencies:

Navigate to the backend directory and install the required dependencies:

cd backend
npm install


### Environment Configuration:

Create a .env file in the backend directory and add the following environment variables:

PORT: Port where the server will run (default: 8000).
MONGO_URI: MongoDB connection string.
ACCESS_TOKEN_SECRET: Secret for access token generation.
ACCESS_TOKEN_EXPIRY: Expiry time for the access token (default: 1d).
REFRESH_TOKEN_SECRET: Secret for refresh token generation.
REFRESH_TOKEN_EXPIRY: Expiry time for the refresh token (default: 10d).
CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME: Cloud name for Cloudinary image storage.
CLOUDINARY_API_KEY: API key for Cloudinary.
CLOUDINARY_API_SECRET: API secret for Cloudinary.
SESSION_SECRET_KEY: Secret key for session management.
NODEMAILER_GMAIL_USERNAME: Gmail username for Nodemailer.
NODEMAILER_GMAIL_PASSWORD: Gmail password for Nodemailer.



### Running the Backend
Once you have installed the dependencies and set up the configuration, you can run the backend by following these steps:

1. Navigate to the backend directory.
2.Run the server with:
**npm start**
OR
**npx nodemon**
3.The backend API will be accessible at http://localhost:8000.
